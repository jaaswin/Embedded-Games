# Snake Game using Raspberry Pi Pico

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements the classic Snake Game on an 8√ó8 LED matrix controlled by the MAX7219 driver IC and a Raspberry Pi Pico. A joystick module provides user input to control the snake's movement. The snake grows in size each time it eats food, and the game ends when it collides with the wall or with itself.

This project demonstrates embedded systems design, SPI communication, real-time gaming logic, and hardware-software integration using MicroPython.

## üéÆ Working Principle

### Display Control
- The MAX7219 chip communicates with the Pico via SPI protocol
- Controls individual pixels on the 8√ó8 LED matrix
- Efficient display refresh using hardware SPI

### Game Logic
- Snake starts with a length of 2-3 pixels
- Food is randomly placed on available positions
- Continuous snake movement in current direction
- Joystick input changes movement direction
- Score increases when snake eats food
- Game ends on collision with walls or self

### Joystick Input Handling
- Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) readings from GP26 and GP27
- **Move Left**: VRx low (< 16,000)
- **Move Right**: VRx high (> 48,000)
- **Move Up**: VRy low (< 16,000)
- **Move Down**: VRy high (> 48,000)

## üíª Code Implementation

### Library & Hardware Setup
```python
from machine import Pin, SPI, ADC
import max7219
import random
import time

# SPI and MAX7219 initialization
spi = SPI(0, baudrate=10000000, polarity=0, phase=0, sck=Pin(2), mosi=Pin(3))
cs = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
matrix = max7219.Matrix8x8(spi, cs, 1)
matrix.brightness(5)

# Joystick setup
joy_x = ADC(26)
joy_y = ADC(27)
joy_btn = Pin(16, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
```

### Game State Variables
```python
# Snake initialization
snake = [(3, 3), (3, 4)]  # List of (x,y) coordinates
direction = (0, -1)       # Initial direction: up
food = None
score = 0
game_active = True
```

### Main Game Loop
```python
def game_loop():
    global snake, direction, food, score, game_active
    
    while True:
        if game_active:
            # Read joystick and update direction
            read_joystick()
            
            # Move snake
            move_snake()
            
            # Check for food collision
            check_food()
            
            # Check for game over conditions
            if check_collision():
                game_over()
            
            # Update display
            update_display()
            
            time.sleep(0.3)  # Game speed
        else:
            # Game over state - wait for restart
            if joy_btn.value() == 0:
                reset_game()
```

### Core Game Functions
```python
def move_snake():
    head_x, head_y = snake[0]
    dir_x, dir_y = direction
    new_head = ((head_x + dir_x) % 8, (head_y + dir_y) % 8)
    snake.insert(0, new_head)
    snake.pop()  # Remove tail unless food eaten

def generate_food():
    while True:
        food_pos = (random.randint(0, 7), random.randint(0, 7))
        if food_pos not in snake:
            return food_pos

def check_food():
    global food, score
    if snake[0] == food:
        # Grow snake by not removing tail
        snake.append(snake[-1])
        score += 1
        food = generate_food()

def check_collision():
    head = snake[0]
    # Check self-collision (head in body)
    return head in snake[1:]

def game_over():
    global game_active
    game_active = False
    # Blink animation
    for _ in range(3):
        matrix.fill(1)
        matrix.show()
        time.sleep(0.3)
        matrix.fill(0)
        matrix.show()
        time.sleep(0.3)
```
