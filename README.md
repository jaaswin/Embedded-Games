#  Embedded Game Projects Collection

Welcome to my **Embedded Game Repository** — a creative playground of **interactive embedded systems and mini-games** built using microcontrollers like **Raspberry Pi Pico**, **STM32**, and **Arduino**.  

This collection showcases how **hardware meets fun**, where LEDs, sensors, and logic come together to create engaging real-world gaming experiences — all coded from scratch!

##  How to Explore

#### 1. Open the project folders available above.  
#### 2. Inside each folder, explore the **project report** to understand the concept, circuit, and working.  
#### 3. I’ve also attached a **project link (hosted on the Wokwi platform)** — this allows you to directly **view, simulate, and explore** the project online.  
#### 4. Use these resources to study, modify, and enhance your own embedded creations!  

>  *These projects are made to help beginners and enthusiasts easily learn, test, and build embedded games hands-on.*
